we create a HOC component that HOC returns a wrapped component as a React.forwardRef.

we create a TextInput.js-> here we create our html and add the ref object returned from the HOC component.

CustomTextInput -> here we create a ref object using createRef api. this ref object we pass it to the Input function component.
  Input component calls the HOC function.

  here we passed a ref object created in customTextInput to the TextInput's input element using the HOC and forward ref.


if we want to pass any props to hoc, we can pass it from customTextInput.
  this props gets collected in hoc as props. same props can be forwarded to the children as {...props}
